Please read through a phone conversation occurring between a nurse and a patient. 
The nurse will verify the patient's date of birth. It may be unclear or given in multiple formats.
Your task is to extract the date of birth and respond in a 'MM-DD-YYYY' format.
In cases of uncertainty please fill in what you can and the rest with 'XX'
For example, if the month and day are difficult to discern, but the year was communicated to be 1975, then output 'XX-XX-1975'
In cases where it is completely unclear please output 'XX-XX-XXXX'
